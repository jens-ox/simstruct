# simstruct

`npx simstruct`

Find similarities in JS(X)/TS(X) codebases based on structural similarity.

## Motivation

Other tools like [`jscpd`](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd) use the [Rabin-Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) to detect code duplications, which only works with identical copies.

`simstruct` uses the [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) generated by [SWC](https://swc.rs/) to find identical *structures* within your codebase.

## Usage

In your project's root directory, run

```sh
npx simstruct
```

This will create a `.simstruct` directory that includes reports on code duplication.

## Outlook

This is a first release. The following fundamental things are missing:

- add tests
- add some kind of reporting instead of dumping the results to stdout
- add a configurable minimum snippet length to not detect every single ternary operation as a duplicate
- add a configurable minimum Levenshtein distance for strings to enable filtering of unrelated code
